# The `wit` format

The Wasm Interface Type (WIT) format is an [IDL] to provide tooling for the
[WebAssembly Component Model][components] in two primary ways:

- WIT is a developer-friendly format to describe the imports and exports to a
  component. It is easy to read and write and provides the foundational basis
  for producing components from guest languages as well as consuming components
  in host languages.

- WIT packages are the basis of sharing types and definitions in an ecosystem of
  components. Authors can import types from other WIT packages when generating a
  component, publish a WIT package representing a host embedding, or collaborate
  on a WIT definition of a shared set of APIs between platforms.

A WIT package is a collection of WIT [`interface`s][interfaces] and
[`world`s][worlds] defined in files in the same directory that all use the
file extension `wit`, for example `foo.wit`. Files are encoded as valid utf-8
bytes. Types can be imported between interfaces within a package using
unqualified names and additionally from other packages through namespace-
and-package-qualified names.

This document will go through the purpose of the syntactic constructs of a WIT
document, a pseudo-formal [grammar specification][lexical-structure], and
additionally a specification of the [package format][package-format] of a WIT
package suitable for distribution.
