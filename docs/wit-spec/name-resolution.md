# Name resolution

A `wit` document is resolved after parsing to ensure that all names resolve
correctly. For example this is not a valid `wit` document:

```wit
type foo = bar;  // ERROR: name `bar` not defined
```

Type references primarily happen through the `id` production of `ty`.

Additionally names in a `wit` document can only be defined once:

```wit
type foo = u32;
type foo = u64;  // ERROR: name `foo` already defined
```

Names do not need to be defined before they're used (unlike in C or C++),
it's ok to define a type after it's used:

```wit
type foo = bar;

record bar {
    age: u32,
}
```

Types, however, cannot be recursive:

```wit
type foo = foo;  // ERROR: cannot refer to itself

record bar1 {
    a: bar2,
}

record bar2 {
    a: bar1,    // ERROR: record cannot refer to itself
}
```
